# TextEditor
As you have progressed through this course, you have put together a number of impressive projects that you can show off to potential employers. This project is no exception; in fact, it features some of the most impressive expressions of the concepts you have learned so far.

My task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
